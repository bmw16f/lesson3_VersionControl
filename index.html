            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version Control is often defined as a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. This becomes extremely useful for programers and developers. This is because if a mistake is made, you are able to go back and look at earlier versions to detect where the mistake might have occurred. Version control allows people to have the history on their files. In addition to the traceability of changes, Version Control also allows  multiple people to work on files simultaneously. This is done by using a branch in Version Control. This is extremely important for this class, because if a mistake occurs, when can look at previous versions of the files to try to detect the error.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">So what is it?</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">This topic goes into what we previously discussed. GIT is the most common version control system. GIT is specifically a distributed version. All that that means is that the code copy you have is a complete control repository. This makes it easier to work on items when you are offline, without the internet. Since it is so easy to upload your copy at any time, it makes GIT a favorite of developers. This is important knowledge to have for this course. In addition, it is incredible that there is software available, where you are able to work offline then upload as you want.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">How do I get this?</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are two ways in which you can gain a GIT repository. The first way is that you can take a local directory that is not under version control, then turn it into a GIT repository. The second way is that you can clone a GIT repository that already exists. NO matter which way you choose, you end up with  a GIT repository on your local machine. This is extremely important because to even be able to do any of the things we will learn in the future, you have to be able to gain access to a GIT repository. As we learned, these are extremely useful because you can work on it on your local computer.</p>

            <h2 class="featurette-heading"GIT vs other VCS
                <span class="text-muted">What is the real difference?</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">All the talk about how amazing GIT is, must have you wondering what the real difference is. Why is GIT so different? There is no huge difference, the main thing that sets GIT apart is the way that it thinks about data. Other VCS think of their data and information as files and the changes that have been made to these files throughout the time of creation. GIT views it as “snapshots”. By viewing the information as snapshots, it is easier in the future to view where possible mistakes were made. This ultimately shows why GIT has taken over the data world. I loved learning about this because it is fascinating to view the information stored as pictures of moments.</p>

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">The Three States of GIT
                <span class="text-muted">Wait what is that?</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">One extremely important thing to remember is that GIT has three states. These means your files can either be in, committed, modified and staged. Committed is when the data is safely stored in your local database. Modified is when you have changed the filed but have not committed it to your database yet. Finally, staged means that you have marked a changed file in the current version to going your next commit snapshot. With this new found knowledge, in the future you will be able to determine what the stage of GIT your file is at. This might prevent issues that you might face in the future.</p>
